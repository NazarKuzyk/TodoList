# TodoList
This is my pet project, which implements the Login system, CRUD, Priority, and Status. It is a simple task list project designed to help users track tasks, prioritize, and mark tasks as completed. And the login system allows each user to specify their tasks, to which only he has access. And does not allow you to view other users' tasks.
